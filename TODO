* Make configurable (serial port, speed, flow control etc)
	Partly done by Cornelius Cook.

* Add option to dump to file and display status on screen.

* Nicer way to terminate program than Ctrl-C/KILLing it.

* Lock serial ports.

* Add filtering rules capability.
	Perhaps look at some regex libraries?

* PTYs? Pipes? So we can look like a serial port to programs that expect to
  talk to one.
