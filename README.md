The software variant runs without any known issues.   
The hardware variant which uses the <a href="https://www.keelog.com/serial-logger/">AirDrive Serial Logger</a> showed some major issues with health check protocols and high volume / continuous data streams. We are currently investigating these issues.

Both variants are covered by this codebase.

Usage
-----

#### Software Proxy Approach

```bash
sudo sersniff -i /dev/ttyUSB0 -o /dev/ttyUSB1 -z -b 19200
```

#### Hardware Proxy Approach

```bash
sudo sersniff -i /dev/ttyACM0 -s -z
```

#### Alternative / Debugging

You can also proxy serial very easily using socat.   
Install it via `sudo apt-get install -y socat`.   
Use it for example to verify everything works as expected:

```bash
sudo socat -x /dev/ttyUSB0,raw,b19200 /dev/ttyUSB1,raw,b19200
```
