The software variant runs without any known issues.   
The hardware variant which uses the <a href="https://www.keelog.com/serial-logger/">AirDrive Serial Logger</a> showed some major issues with health check protocols and high volume / continuous data streams. We are currently investigating these issues.

Both variants are covered by this codebase. For more information on how to run each of them, see <a href="./run.sh">run.sh</a>.
