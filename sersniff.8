.SH NAME
sersniff \- a program to tunnel/sniff between 2 serial ports
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sersniff
.RI [-h] [-i DEVICE ] [-o DEVICE] [-b BAUD] [-s] [-n] [-w USECS] [-z]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page explains how to use the
.B sersniff
command.  
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.

.SH OPTIONS
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-h
Show summary of options.
.TP
.B \-i \fP\fUfile
Set the device to use for Port1. Default of /dev/ttyS0. If you want
to listen on a TCP port then use the format :port. If there's a / in
the string then it will always be treated as a device rather than a
port to listen on.
.TP
.B \-o \fP\fUfile
Set the device to use for Port2. Default of /dev/ttyS1. If you want
to connect to a TCP port then use the format host:port. Again if
there's a / in the string then it will always be treated as a device.
.TP
.B \-b \fP\fUbaud
Specify baud rate for serial connections. Defaults to 19200.
.TP
.B \-s
Make sersniff not copy data between the two ports - useful if a
Y cable is being used for serial port sniffing for example.
.TP
.B \-n
Don't do any port configuration.
.TP
.B \-w \fP\fUusecs
How many microsecs to wait before reporting a delay
.TP
.B \-x
Show hex characters instead of normal ASCII characters.
.TP
.B \-z
Don't quit when an EOF character is received.
.TP
.B \-f
Specify the format string that should be used to print hex characters.
